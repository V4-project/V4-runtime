# ESP-IDF Component Dependencies for V4 RTOS Runtime
#
# Minimal component manifest for ESP-IDF Component Manager.
# Documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/

dependencies:
  # ESP-IDF version requirement
  idf:
    version: ">=5.1.0"

# Note: Required builtin ESP-IDF components (driver, freertos, esp_system, log)
# are automatically available and don't need to be declared here.
#
# V4 kernel and V4-hal are integrated via CMakeLists.txt from local directories
# or via FetchContent.
#
# Future external component dependencies can be added here, for example:
# dependencies:
#   example-component:
#     version: "^1.0.0"
#     git: https://github.com/example/component.git
